Much like how TypeScript analyzes runtime values using static types, it overlays type analysis on JavaScript's runtime control flow constructs like `if/else`, conditional ternaries, loops, truthiness checks, etc., which can all affect those types.

By using _narrowing_, TypeScripts makes use of control flow constructs as a special form of code called a _type guard_. TypeScript follows possible paths of execution that our programs can take to analyze the most specific possible type of a value at a given position.

There are a couple of different constructs TypeScript understands for narrowing.

## `typeof` type guards

JavaScript supports a `typeof` operator which can give very basic information about the type of values we have at runtime and TypeScript can understand it to narrow types in different branches.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  if (typeof strs === "object") {
    for (const s of strs) {
/* Object is possibly 'null'. */
      console.log(s);
    }
  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {
    console.log(strs);
  } else {
    // do nothing
  }
}
```

We have to be careful using `typeof` in JavaScript because of its quirks. In the example shown above, you wouldn't expect it but in JavaScript, `typeof null` is actually an type of "Object".

## Truthiness narrowing

Not a word, but definitely a JavaScript concept. Using any expressional in conditionals, `&&`, `||`, `if` statements, Boolean negations `!`, and more. In JavaScript, `if` statements don't expect their conditions to always have the type `boolean`.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function getUsersOnlineMessage(numUsersOnline: number) {
  if (numUsersOnline) {
    return `There are ${numUsersOnline} online now!`;
  }
  return "Nobody's here. :(";
}
```

In JavaScript, constructs like `if` first "coerce" their conditions to `boolean` to make sense of them, and then choose their brances depending on whether the result is `true` or `false`.

For example, values such as:

-   `0`
-   `Nan`
-   `""` (the empty string)
-   `0n` (the `biginit` version of zero)
-   `null`
-   `undefined`

All coerce to `false`, and other values get coerced `true`. You can always coerce values to `boolean` by running them through the `Boolean` function, or by using the shorter double-Boolean negation `!!`. This is helpful to guard against values like `null` and `undefined`. Here's an example using the `printAll` function we used before:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  if (strs && typeof strs === "object") {
    for (const s of strs) {
      console.log(s);
    }
  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {
    console.log(strs);
  }
}
```

## Equality narrowing

TypeScript also uses `switch` statements and equality checks like `===`, `!==`, `==`, and `!=` to narrow types. Checking against specific literal values (as opposed to variables) also works `if(str !== null)`.

JavaScript's looser equality checks with `==` and `!=` also gets narrowed correctly. Checking against `null` also checks whether it's potentially `undefined` as well and the same works the other way around.

## The `in` operator narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for determining if an object has a property with a name: the `in` operator. The `in` operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
class Animal {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) { this.name = name }
}

class Fish extends Animal {
  swim() { console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I'm swimming`) }
}

class Bird extends Animal {
  fly() { console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I'm flying`) }
}

const dory = new Fish("Dory");
const bp = new Bird("Bird Person");

function move(animal: { swim: () => void } | { fly: () => void }) {
  "swim" in animal ? animal.swim() : animal.fly();
}

move(dory);
move(bp);
```
