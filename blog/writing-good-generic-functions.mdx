title: Writing Good Generic Functions

Writing generic functions is fun but taking it too far can make inference less successful.

## Push Type Parameters Down

> When possiblee, use the type parameter itself rather than constraining it.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function firstElement1<Type>(arr: Type[]): Type | undefined {
  return arr.shift()
}
```

This function is better than extending the type in `<Type extends any[]>`. This would infer the return type as `any` because TypeScript has to resolve the return expression using the constrain type, rather than 'waiting' to resolve the element during a call.

## Use Fewer Type Parameters

> Always use as few type parameters as possible.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function customFilter<Type>(arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[] {
    return arr.filter(func);
}
```

## Type Parameters Should Appear Twice

> If a type parameter only appears in one location, strongly reconsider if you actually need it.

Type parameters are for relating the types of multiple values. Otherwise, it isn't relating to anything. This doesn't make sense:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function greet<Str extends string>(s: Str){
    console.log(`Hello, ${s}`);
}
```
