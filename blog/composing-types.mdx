With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with unions, and with generics.

## What are Unions and Generics?

**Unions** declare that a type could be one of many. We can use this to describe a set of `string` or `number` literals that a value is allowed to be. They can also be helpful to handle different types as well (i.e. in a function):

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";
type PositiveOddNumbersUnderTen = 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;

function getLength(obj: string | string[]) {
    return obj.length;
}
```

**Generics** provides variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
type StringArray = Array<string>;
type NumberArray = Array<number>;
type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>
```

## Structural Type System

In TypeScript, type checking focuses on the _shape_ that values have. This is referred to as "duck typing" or "structural typing". In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.

TypeScript compares the shape of an object in the type-check. If they have the same shape, the code passes. The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object's fields to match.

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
interface Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}

function logPoint( p: point ) {
    console.log(`${p.x}, ${p.y}`);
}

const point = { x: 12, y: 24, z: 32 };
logPoint(point); // logs "12, 24"
```
