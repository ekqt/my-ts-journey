description: Using string literal types in unions helps us strictly handle complex structures...

We are able to narrow single variables with simple primitive types. While this is common, most of the time in JavaScript structures are slighly more complex.

We can use the union of string literal types, such as `circle` and `square` in a shape object, to tell us whether we should treat the property of an object respectively. Using literal types instead of primitive one like `string` can avoid misspelling issues.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface Shape {
    kind: "circle" | "square";
    radius?: number;
    sideLength?: number;
}
```

The issue here is that we need to take into account the optional properties we have defined. Where a kind `circle` may have a `radius`, it will not have a `sideLength` and the other way around. To make this interface work, we set both of this properties as optional. If we access them to return a value within a function, their type will be `number | undefined` and TypeScript will indicate that the Object is possibly 'undefined'.

Even if it isn't ideal, here we can use a non-null assertion (a `!` after `shape.radius`) to say that `radius` is definitely present.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    if (shape.kind === "circle") {
        return Math.PI * shape.radius! ** 2;
    }
}
```

This solution is error-prone if we start moving code around. Additional, outside of `strictNullChecks` we're able to accidentally access any of those fields anyway (since optional properties are just assumed to always be present when reading them). We can do better.

The problem with this encoding of Shape is that the type-checker doesn't have any way to know whether or not `radius` or `sideLength` are present based on the `kind` property. A better approach would be:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;
```

Now that `Shape` is a union. We would have to narrow the by `kind` before accessing `radius` or `sideLength` properties.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
  }
}
```

> When every type in a union contains a common property with literal types (such as `kind`), TypeScript considers taht to be a _discriminated union_, and can narrow out the members of the union.
