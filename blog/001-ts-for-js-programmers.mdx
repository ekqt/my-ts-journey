# TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers

> TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.

## Types by Inference

TypeScript knows that JavaScript will generate types automatically in many cases. When creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value to infer its type:

```TypeScript
let helloWorld = 'Hello World';
let helloWorld: string;
```

## Defining Types

Some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming). In this case, you can explicitly describe an object's shape using an `interface` declaration:

```TypeScript
const user = {
    name: 'Hector',
    id: 0
};

interface User {
    name: string,
    id: number
};
```

You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new `interface` by using syntax like `: TypeName` after a variable declaration:

```TypeScript
const user: User = {
    name: 'Hector',
    id: 0
};
```

If you provide an object that doesn't match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you.

### Support for Classes and OOP

Both languages support classess and OOP, here's an example:

```TypeScript
class UserAccount {
    name: string;
    id: number;

    constructor(name: string, id: number){
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
}

const user: User new UserAccount('Murphy', 1);
```

### Primitive Types

In JavaScript we already have `boolean`, `bigint`, `null`, `number`, `string`, `symbol`, and `undefined`, which we can set in an interface. TypeScript extendes this list with a few more, such as `any` (allow anything), `unknown` (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), `never` (it's not possible that this type could happen), and `void` (a function which returns `undefined` or has no return value).

There are two syntaxes for building types: `interfaces` and `types`. As default use `interface`, `type` should only be used when specific features are required.

TBC: Expand on `unknown` and `never` from [resources](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html#defining-types).
