# Welcome!

> TypeScript all things, this project is intended to be an independent blog to keep track of my TS journey.

I'm managing this blog based on a project starter I created that uses MDX to power Next.js applications only using `next-mdx-remote` and `@tailwindcss/typography`. 

**NOTHING** else is required, but _nice to have_ are these plugins for your parser: `rehype-autolink-headings`, `rehype-prism-plus` and `rehype-slug` to make your life easier.

If you are interested in creating a similar blog, here's the link to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ekqt/mdx-project-starter) and here's the [live demo](https://mdx-project-starter.vercel.app/) for the project starter.
