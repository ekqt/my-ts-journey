description: Every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can observe from running different operations...

> When we run out code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses what to do is by figuring out the **type** of the value, what sorts of behaviors and capabilities it has.

We can identify `TypeError` mistakes by identifying primitives at runtime using the `typeof` operator with the exception of things like functions where there is no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify their types. For example:

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
function fn(x) {
    return x.flip();
}
```

This code will only run with an object with a callable `flip` property, but JavaScript doesn't have this information in a way we can check while the code is running. The only way to know is to call it and see what happens. This behavior makes it difficult to predict what the code is going to do while you're writing it.

In this perspective, a _type_ is the concept of describing which values can be passed to `fn` and which will crash.

> JavaScript only truly provides **dynamic** typing, you need to run the code to see what happens.

What TypeScript offers is the _alternative_ being a _static_ type system to make predictions about what code is expecte _before_ it runs.

_Static type systems_ describe the shapes and behaviorsof what our values will be when we run our programs. A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be going off the rails.

## Non-exception Failures

There are cases where the ECMASCript specification doesn't have explicit instructions on how the language should behave when it runs into something unexpected. The easiest example is when accessing a property that doesn't exist, JavaScript gives us a different behavior and returns the value `undefined`.

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
const user = {
    name: "Daniel",
    age: 28,
};

user.location; // returns undefined
```

A static type system like Typescript calls out these bugs in our programs. It also has the ability to catch _typos_, uncalled functions or basic logic errors.

## Types for Tooling

The type-checker has information to check things like whether we're accessing the right properties on variables and other properties. Once it has that information, it can also start _suggesting_ which properties you might want to use. This means that Typescript can be leverage for code editing too, the core type-checker can not only provide error messages but also code completion as you type.

This allows TypeScript to deliver "quick fixes" to automatically fix errors, refactorings to easily re-organize code, and useful navigation features for jumpting to definitions of a variable, or finding all references to a given variable.

## Strictness

> TypeScript has several type-checking strictness flags that can be turned on or off. The `strict` fall in the CLI, or `"strict": true` in a `tsconfig.json` toggles them all on simultaneously, but we can opt out of them individually.

The two biggest ones you should know about are `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks`.

-   `noImplicitAny` will issue errors on any variables whos type is implicitly inferred as `any`.
-   `strictNullChecks` makes handling these more explicit and forces us to remember to handle them.
