## A small note on primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

Each of these correspsond to a type in TypeScript. The type names (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will rarely appear in your code. It's best **ALWAYS** to use the lowercase for types.

## Arrays

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
const numArray: number[] = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
const stringArray:  string[] = [ "one", "two", "three" ];
```

## `any`

This special type will allow you to do anything that's syntactically legal:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = 'hello';
const n: number = obj;
```

If you want to avoid the compiler to default to `any` (because it isn't type-checked), use the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to flag any implicit `any` as an error.

> In most cases, TypeScript tries to automatically _infer_ the types in your code based on the type of its initializer.

## Functions

**Parameter Type Annotations** can be added after each parameter to declare what ypes of parameters the function accepts. Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name. Even if you don't have type annotations on your parameters, TypeScript will still check that you passed the right number of arguments.

**Return Type Annotations** can be added after the parameter list. Much like the variable type annotations, you usually don't need to return type annotation because TypesScript will infer the function's return type based on its `return` statements.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
    return 26;
}
```

**Anonymous Functions** automatically give their parameters types _contextually_ (also called _contextual typing_) so it infers its types based on the type of context where these functions are being called.

## Object Types

The most common sort of type (apart from the primitives) will be the _object type_. Here's an example:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {
    console.log( pt.x, pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```

You can use `.` or `;` to separate the properties (last separator is optional either way).

**Optional properties** can also specify that some or all of their properties are _optional_ by adding the `?` after the property name: `{first: string; last?: string}`.

> In JavaScript, you'll get the value `undefined` rathen than a runtime error when accessing a property that doesn't exist. Therefore, you'll have to check for `undefined` before using it:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function printLastName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
    obj.last !== undefined && console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());

    /* OR alternatively */
    console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```

## Union Types

Union types combine existing ones formed fro two or more other types to represent values that may be _any_ one of those types. We refer to each of these types as the union's _members_:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function printId(id: number | string) {
    console.log(`Your ID is: ${id}`);
}
```

> When working with Union types TypeScript will only allow operators that are valid for _every_ member of the union.

If you have issues with operators that are only valid for certain types of union members. The solution is to _narrow_ the code using conditional statements OR using operators tha the union members would all have in common.

## Type Aliases

Are useful if you need to re-use them elsewhere by calling them by a common name.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function printCoord(pt: Point) { console.log(pt.x, pt.y) };
```
Can also be used without objects, such as `type ID = number | string`.

> An *interface declaration* is another way to name an object type. For differences you can reference [Interfaces vs. Types](defining-types#interfaces-vs-types).

## Type Assertions

Sometimes you will have information about the type of value that TypeScript can't know about.

For example. if you're using `document.getElementById`, TypeScript only knows that this will return *some* kind of `HTMLElement`, but you might know that your page will always have an `HTMLCanvasElement` with a given ID.

In this situation, you can use a *type assertion* to specify a more specific type:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
const myCanva = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
const myCanva = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```
