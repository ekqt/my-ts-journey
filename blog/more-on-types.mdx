## The Array Type

Generic object types are often container types that work independent from the type of element they contain. It's ideal for data structures to work this way so that they're re-usable across different data types.

Just like we have been working with `number[]` and `string[]`, those are really shorthands for `Array<number>` and `Array<string>`.

Modern JavaScript also provides other data structures which are generic, like `Map<K, V>` and `Set<T>`, and `Promise<T>`. All of this means is that because of how `Map`, `Set`, and `Promise` behave, they can work with any sets of types.

## The `ReadonlyArray` Type

This is a special type that describes arrays that shouldn't be changed by using `ReadonlyArray<string>`.

Unlike `Array`, there isn't a `ReadonlyArray` constructor that we can use. Instead, we can assign regular `Array`s to `ReadonlyArray`s:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
const roArray: ReadonlyArray<string> = ["red", "green", "blue"];
const alsoRoArray: readonly string[] = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

Just as TypeScript provides a shorthand syntax for `Array<Type>` with `Type[]`, it also provides a shorthand syntax for `ReadonlyArray<Type>` with `readonly Type[]`.

Keep in mind that you cannot assign different types to `readonly` types.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
let x: readonly string[] = [];
let y: string[] = [];

x = y; // Okay
y = x; // Not okay

// There is no bidirectional assignability.
```

## Tuple Types

A _tuple type_ is another sort of `Array` type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions: `type StringNumberPair = [string, number]`.

Like `ReadonlyArray`, it has no representation at runtime, but is significant to TypeScript. Describing arrays whos `0` index contains a `string` and whose `1` index contains a number.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {
    const a = pair[0]; // string
    const b = pair[1]; // number
}
doSomething(['Hello', 42]);
```

We can also destructure tuples using JavaScript's array destructuring.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function doSomething(stringHash: [string, number]) {
    const [inputString, hash] = stringHash;
    console.log(inputString, hash);
}
```

Other than those length checks, simple tuple types like these are equivalent to types which are versions of `Array`s that declare properties for specific indexes, and that declare `length` with a numeric literal type.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface StringNumberPair {
    // Specialized property
    length: 2;
    0: string;
    1: number;
}
```

Tuples do have support for optional properties but they can only come at the end, and also affect the type of `length`.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
type Either2dOr3d = [number, number, number?];

function setCoordinate(coord: Either2dOr3d) {
    const [x, y, z] = coord;
    // (property) length: 2 | 3
    console.log(coord.length);
}
```

### Tuples and Rest elements

Tuples can also have rest elements, which have to be an array/tuple type.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
type StringNumberBooleans = [string, number, ...boolean[]];
```

This type describes a tuple whose first two elements are `string` and `number` respectively, but which may have any number of `boolean`s following. A tuple with a rest element, has no set 'length'.

Tuples types can be used in rest parameters and arguments, like so:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function buttonInput(...args: [string, number, ...boolean[]]) {
    const[ name, version, ...input] = args;
}
```

### `readonly` Tuple Types

Tuples tend to be created and left un-modified in most code, so annotating types as `readonly` tuples when possible is a good practice. This is also important given that array literals with `const` assertions will be inferred with `readonly` tuple types.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
let point = [3, 4] as const;

function distanceFromOrigin([x,y]: [number, number]) {
    return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);
}

distanceFromOrigin(poiint); // Not Okay
// Argument of type 'readonly [3, 4]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[number, number]'.
```

Here, the function never modifies its elements, but expects a mutable tuple. The mutable tuple defined in the function can't guarantee `point`'s elements won't be mutated.
