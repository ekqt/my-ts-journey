_Object types_ in TypeScript can be anonymous, declared using an interface or a type alias:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function greet(person: { name: string; age: number }) {
    return "Hello " + person.name;
}

interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

// type Person = { name: string; age: number; };

function greetv2(person: Person) {
    return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```

All three examples are making use of the same object type.

## Property Modifiers

Each property in an object type can specify a couple of things: (a) the type, (b) whether the property is optional, and (c) whether the property can be written to.

### Optional Properties

Much of the time, we'll find ourselves dealing with objects that _might_ have a property set. We can mark then as _optional_ by adding `?` to the end of their names:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface PaintOptions {
    shape: Shape;
    xPos?: number; // Optional
    yPost?: number; // Optional
}

function paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {...}
```

> All optionality really says is that if the property is _set_, it better have a specific type.

We can also read from those properties - but when we do under `strictNullChecks`, TypeScript will tell us they're potentially `undefined`.

The pattern of setting default for unspecified values is so common that JavaScript has syntax to support it.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function paintShape({ shape, xPos = 0, yPos = 0}: PaintOptions) {...};
```

> Note we cannot place type annotations within destructuring patterns.

### `readonly` Properties

Properties can also be marked as `readonly` for TypeScript. While it won't change any behavior at runtime, a property marked as `readonly` can't be written to during type-checking.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface SomeType {
    readonly prop: string;
}

function doSomething(obj: SomeType) {
    console.log(obj.prop); // OK
    obj.prop = 'Hello'; // Not OK
}
```

Using the `readonly` modifier doesn't necessarily imply that a value is totally immutable - or in other words, that its internal contents can't be changed. It just means that property itself can't be re-written to.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface Home {
    readonly resident: { name: string, age: number };
}

function doSomething(home: Home) {
    home.resident.age++ // OK
    home.resident = { name: "Victor", age: 42 }; // Not OK
}
```

### Index Signatures

Sometimes you don't know all the names of a type's properties ahead of time, but you do know the shape of the values.

In those cases, you can use an index signature to describe the types of possibles values, for example:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface StringArray {
    [index: number]: string;
}

const myArray: StringArray = getStringArray();
const secondItem = myArray[1]; // const secondItem = string;
```

This index signature states that when a `StringArray` is indexed with a `number`, it will return a `string`.

> An index signature property type must be either a 'string' or 'number'.

You are able to use different types if the index signature is a union of the property types:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface NumberOrStringDictionary {
    [index: string]: number | string;
}
```
