TypeScript extends the list of JavaScript primitive types adding `unknown` and `never` into the mix. `unknown` acts like a sibling to the `any` type. Where `any` allows for ambiguity, `unknown` requires specifics.

## Difference between `unknown` and `any`

The objects consuming a function that returns an `unknown` type cannot be used until the type has been declared to TypeScript. This can be used to ensure that API consumers think about their typing up-front:

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
const jsonParse = (jsonString: string): unknown => JSON.parse(jsonString);

interface User {
    name: string;
}

const myUserAccount = jsonParse(`{ "name" : "Samuel" }`) as User;
```

`unknown` is to be considered as a type-safe counterpart of `any`.

> Anything is assignable to `unknown`, but it isn't assignable to anything but itself.

## What is `never`?

Because TypeScript supports code flow analysis, the language needs to be able to represent when code logically cannot happen. TypeScript can infer the type `never` when code logically cannot happen, for example:

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
const neverReturns = () => {
    throw new Error('Always throws, never returns');
}
/* Hover: const neverReturns: () => never */
```

However, a value type `never` can still be passed around like other values. It is useful when dealing with the unpredictability of JavaScript and API consumers that might not be using types:

```TypeScript withLineNumbers
const validateUser = (user: User) => {
    if (user) {
        return user.name !== 'Nan';
    }
    return neverReturns();
}
```

## Interfaces vs. Types

These are the two main tools to declare the shape of an object. Because TypeScript is a structural type system, it's possible to intermix their use. For the most common cases, they act the same. Here is what to note:

-   They both support extending other interfaces and types.
-   Type aliases do this via intersection types (using `&`), while interfaces have an `extends` keyword.
-   TypeScript provides more focused messages when working with interfaces than with types.
-   Interfaces are open and types are closed, which means you can only redeclare Interfaces.
-   For publicly exposed types, it's a better call to make them an interface.
-   Unlike an interface, the type alias can also be used for other types such as primitives, unions and tuples.
