## Declaring `this` in a function

TypeScript will infer what the `this` should be in a function via code flow analysis, for example:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
const user = {
    id: 123,
    admin: false,

    becomeAdmin: function() {
        this.admin = true;
    }
}
```

There are cases where you need more control over what object `this` means. JavaScript specification states that you cannot have a parameter called `this`, so TypeScript uses that syntax space to let you declare the type for `this` in the function body.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface DB {
    filterUsers(filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];
}

const db = getDB();
const admins = db.filterUsers(function (this: User)) {
    return this.admin;
}
```

Note that you need to use `function` and not arrow functions to get this behavior.

## Other Types to Know about

### `void`

`void` represents the return value of cuntions which don't return a value. It's the inferred type any time a function doesn't have any `return` statements, or doesn't return any explicit value from those return statements:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
// The inferred return type is void
// function noop(): void
function noop(){
    return;
}
```

In JavaScript, a function that doesn't return any value will implicitly return the value `undefined`. However, `void` and `undefined` are not the same thing in TypeScript. There are further details at the end of this chapter.

### `object`

The special type `object` refers to any value that isn't a primitive. This is different from the _empty object type_ `{}`, and also different from the global type `Object`.

> `object` is **NOT** `Object`. **Always** use `object`!

Note that in JavaScript, function values are objects. They have properties, have `Object.prototype` in their prototype chain, are `instanceof Object`, you can call `Object.keys` on them, and so on. For this reason, function types are considered to be `object`s in TypeScript.

### `unknown`

The `unknown` type represents _any_ value. This is similar to the `any` type, but is safer because it's not legal to do anything with an `unknown` value.

This is useful when describing function types because you can describe functions that accept any value without having `any` values in your function body.

Conversly, you can describe a function that returns a value of unknown type:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function safeParse(s: string) :unknown {
    return JSON.parse(s);
}

const obj = safeParse(someRandomString);
```

### `never`

Some functions _never_ return a value:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function fail(msg: string): never {
    throw new Error(msg);
}
```
The `never` type represents values which are *never* observed. In a return type, this means that the function throws an exception or terminates execution of the program. `never` also appears when TypeScript determines there's nothing left in a union.

### `Function`

The global type `Function` describes properties like `bind`, `call`, `apply`, and others present on all function values in JavaScript. It also has the special property that values of type `Function` can always be called; these calls return `any`.
