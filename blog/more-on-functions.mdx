## Function Type Expressions

The simplest way to describe a function is with a **function type expression**. These types are syntactically similar to arrow functions `fn: (a: string) => void`:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function greeter(fn: (a: string) => void) {
  fn("Hello, World");
}

function printToConsole(s: string) {
  console.log(s);
}

greeter(printToConsole);
```

The syntax `(a: string) => void` means a function with one parameter, named `a`, of type string, that doesn't have a return value (thus `void`). Just like with function declarations, if a parameter type isn't specified, it's implicitly any.

### Using Type Alias

We could use a type alias to name a function type:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
type GreetFunctionType = (a: string) => void;

function greeter(fn: GreetFunction) {
  //...
}
```

## Call Signatures

In JavaScript, functions can have properties in addition to being callable. However, the function type expression syntax doesn't allow for declaring properties. In this case, we write a _call signature_ in an object type `(someArg: number): boolean` like such:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
type DescribableFunction = {
  description: string;
  (someArg: number): boolean;
}
```

Note that the syntax is slightly different compared to a function type expression - use `:` between the parameter list and the return type rather than `=>`.

## Construct Signatures

JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the `new` operator. TypeScript refer to these as _constructors_ because they usually create a new object. You can write a _construct signature_ by adding the `new` keyword in front of a call signature: `new (s: string): someObject`.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
type SomeConstructor = {
  new (s: string): {};
};
function func(constrc: SomeConstructor) {
  return new constrc("Hello World");
}

class Greet {
  greeting: string;
  constructor(str: string) { this.greeting = str }
}

console.log(func(Greet)); // Logs returned Obj
```

Some objects, like JavaScript's `Date` object, can be called with or without `new`. You can combine call and construct signatures in the same type arbitrarily:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
interface CallOrConstruct {
  new (s: string): Date;
  (n?: number): number; // here parameter is optional when calling just Date()
}
```
