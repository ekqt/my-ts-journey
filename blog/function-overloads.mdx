In TypeScript we can specify a function that can be called in different ways by writing _overload signatures_. To do this, write some number of function signatures (usually two or more), followed by the body of the function.

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function makeDate(timestamp: number): Date;
function makeDate(m: number, d: number, y: number): Date
function makeDate(mOrTimestamp: number, d?: number, y?: number): Date {
 return d && y ? new Date(y, mOrTimestamp, d) : new Date(mOrTimestamp);
}

const d1 = makeDate(12345678); // Okay
const d2 = makeDate(5, 5, 5); // Okay
const d3 = makeDate(1, 3); // Not Okay
```

In the last case we would get a Type error saying: No overload expects 2 arguments, but overloads do exist that except either 1 or 3 arguments. The first two signatures are called _overload signatures_.

After the overload signatures, there is a function implementation with a compatible signature. Functions have an _implementation signature_, but this signature can't be called directly. Even though we wrote a function with two optional parameters after the required one, it can't be called with two parameters.

> The signature of the _implementation_ is not visible from the outside. When writing an overload function, you should always have _two_ or more signatures above the implementation of the function.

## Writing Good Overloads

Let's consider a function that returns the length of a string or an array:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
function len(s: string): number;
function len(arr: any[]): number;
function len(x: any) {
  return x.length;
}
```

This function is fine, we can invoke it with string or arrays. However, we can't invoke it with a value that might be a string _or_ an array, because TypeScript can only resolve a function call to a single overload:

```TypeScript showLineNumbers
len(""); // Okay
len([0]); // Okay
len(Math.random() > 0.5 ? "String" : [0]) // Error
```

In this case it's best just to write a non-overloaded version of the function because they both have the same argument count and same return type: `function len(x: any[] | string): number`.

> Always prefer parameters with union types instead of overloads when possible.
